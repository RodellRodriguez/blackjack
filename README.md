# blackjack
Simple Blackjack game in Python.

Must launch the blackjack.py to start the game.

Improvements to be made:
1.) If multiple players get 21, then the program does not account for how each player got their score of 21. The official ruling of blackjack gives priority to any player who achieved a score of 21 by having one Ace and one J,Q, or K. So if a one player gets 21 by having an Ace and J and another player gets 21 by getting 2 Q's and an Ace then the first player technically wins. This code simply results in a tie for such cases.

2.) Did not incorporate players vs the dealer, only players vs players. Technically if all players bust then the dealer wins but there are no dealers in this code

3.) Need for cleaner code
